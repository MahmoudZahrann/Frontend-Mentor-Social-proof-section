## Overview
-------------------
This is my first ever project. I had a bit of a struggle with what I assume is the basics of web development. However, I'm sure it'll get easier with more practice. It took 2 days and a lot of fun times. Have fun checking my code.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size. Screen sizes used are 1440px and 375px.


### My process
-----------------------
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I earned more experience on how to use FlexBox display. Also had a bit of a struggle learning how to pick the most optimal values for margins and paddings. Also learning how to adjust the width of a div or paragraph to perfectly fit the design.

(A piece of code I'm proud of) ::
```CSS
.ratings {
        margin: 8px 48px; 
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
    }
    .ratings:first-child {
        margin: 0px 96px 8px 0px;
    }
    .ratings:last-child {
        margin: 8px 0px 0px 96px;
    }

### Continued development

Looking forward to continue learning and being an expert at finding the suitable margins & paddings. And know when to use them and when to use FlexBox. 

### Useful resources

- https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ - This website helped explain the basics of FlexBox before I apply them on the CSS design.
- http://flexboxfroggy.com/ - This is an amazing application which helped me finally understand FlexBox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw-YO_uS75s - This YouTube video explains how to use the FlexBox Chrome tool from the dev tools. It's a perfect tool for getting the best FlexBox properties and their attributes for your CCS design.
